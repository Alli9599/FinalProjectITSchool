This is my last project done in my Front-End Web Development course. In this project you will be able to see 5 categories of news: Tech, Football, Culture, Books and Travel. On the "Home page" page you will be able to see 6 cards from each category, moreover, you will be able to add to favorites, receiving an alert that it was successfully added and they will remain in favorites until the user deletes the respective news.                                    
The project has been deployed here: https://final-project-itschool.netlify.app/
